              Over a year ago, we embarked on a journey to create a platform
              specifically designed for campus residents in Nigeria to buy and
              sell online with ease. At that time, none of the existing
              e-commerce solutions offered the control and flexibility we needed
              to truly empower our community—so we decided to build our own.
              That&apos;s how Shopiva was born: a user-friendly, all-in-one
              solution that caters to sellers&apos; needs, from inventory
              management to secure transactions, giving them the freedom to
              focus on what they do best.
              <br />
              <br />
              Today, Shopiva has grown beyond just serving campuses; it has
              become the go-to platform for businesses of all sizes. Whether
              you&apos;re an online seller, running a physical retail store, or
              making sales on-the-go, Shopiva equips you with powerful tools to
              manage, expand, and simplify your business. We&apos;re proud to
              support entrepreneurs across Nigeria as they build successful
              businesses on their own terms with Shopiva by their side.
